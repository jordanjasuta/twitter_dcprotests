## Mixed Twitter analysis - #DCprotests May-June 2020

This very basic analysis was conducted on tweets using the hashtag #dcprotests in the month of May 2020.
Tweets were scrapped using: https://github.com/twintproject/twint
and cleaned using the jupyter notebook `Twitter.ipynb` to produce `processed_tweets.csv`.
Major analysis inspiration was drawn from https://datavizm20.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/13-example/#complete-code

** _A MAJOR DISCLAIMER: this analysis is neither exhaustive nor statistically significant. Yes, twitter includes tweets from trolls and bots. Yes, the voices of more active tweeters are awarded disproportionate weight. However, this preliminary analysis can still provide important insight into the activity on the ground in Washington, DC this week, where official news and data sources have been frustratingly unhelpful._ **
